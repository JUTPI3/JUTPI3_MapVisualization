## 🔍 About This Project

**JABODETABEK Urban Transportation Policy Integration Project Phase 3 (JUTPI Phase-3: 2022-2025)** is a technical cooperation project jointly promoted by the **Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)** and the **Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA), Republic of Indonesia**, aiming to develop integrated urban transport policies and TOD (Transit-oriented development) promotion in the Jakarta metropolitan region (Jabodetabek).

These interactive maps were designed and disseminated to visualize and share information about the proposed future public transit network in JABODETABEK, developed by JUTPI-Phase 3 in collaboration with FDTJ (Forum Diskusi Transportasi Jakarta). The map is expected to foster momentum for future public transportation enhancements and act as a catalyst for TOD implementation through cross-sectoral collaboration and public engagement, contributing to long-term mobility improvements in Jabodetabek.

The online map visualization and dashboard offer a spatial overview of proposed public transit developments by the year 2045, including:
- Proposed and existing lines by mode and by lone (Public Transit Network Proposal in Jakarta-Jabodetabek Towards 2045 and Future)
- Population density overlays
- Transfer and stop point visualization
- Interactive layer controls

Note: This visualization of public transit lines and stops was developed at the metropolitan master-plan scale and is not intended for detailed engineering purposes.
